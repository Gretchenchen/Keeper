# Keeper
This is a Keeper APP for taking notes with 2 attributes (title, take a note) using React framework (JSX, Props, Hooks-useState, Form, Map, Filter, Destructing Arrays, Spread Operator, Material UI);

Implemented the add note functionality: create a constant that keeps track of the title and content; pass the new note back to the APP; add new note to an array; take array and render separate note components for each item;

Implemented the delete note functionality: callback from the note component to trigger a delete function; use the filter function to filter out the item that needs deletion; pass an id over to the note component, pass it back to the APP when deleting;

Incorporated CSS and react component Material UI for stylish.
